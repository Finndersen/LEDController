# LEDController
This is a framework or set of components which make it easy to define animated patterns and map them to segments of an LED strip controlled by an Arduino.

## **Requirements**

 - Ardunio-compatible micocontroller. At least 32kB of RAM and decent CPU is recommended depending on the complexity of your project, a [Teensy 3.1+](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/index.html) works great.
 - [FastLED](http://fastled.io/) Library
 - Individually addressable LED strip compatible with FastLED (e.g. Neopixel, WS2801, WS2811, WS2812B, LPD8806, TM1809, and [more](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/Chipset-reference))

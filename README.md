This is a framework or set of components which make it easy to define animated patterns and map them to segments of an LED strip controlled by an Arduino. It helps with developing more complex LED projects (infinity mirrors etc) that involve multiple changing patterns and 

## **Requirements**

 - Ardunio-compatible micocontroller. At least 32kB of RAM and decent CPU is recommended depending on the complexity of your project, a [Teensy 3.1+](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/index.html) works great.
 - [FastLED](http://fastled.io/) Library
 - Individually addressable LED strip compatible with FastLED (e.g. Neopixel, WS2801, WS2811, WS2812B, LPD8806, TM1809, and [more](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/Chipset-reference))
